## Title

Lawful Intercept Response Playbook

## Type

Procedural (How-to steps)

## Purpose

This document is an excerpt from a playbook written for the Alpha's Security team. It provides step-by-step instructions for responding to lawful intercept requests made by law enforcement agencies. The document includes critical processes such as gathering necessary information, setting up a VPN tunnel using Terraform or a GUI, and troubleshooting potential issues.

## Questions

*Whether the content was written solely by you, or if you were part of a team that worked on the content. If you were part of a team, please identify as exactly as possible which portions were your responsibility.*

‣ I authored over 75% of the content, gathering information through interviews, emails, and chats with Network Engineers. I obtained the code samples and screenshots from the engineering team, as I did not have access to the systems due to security restrictions. I followed the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide.

*If you used generative AI during the writing process, please describe how the tool was used.*

‣ I did not use AI to generate content for this document. However, I leveraged prompt engineering to research lawful intercept processes, including legal and compliance aspects, IP range conflicts between VPN endpoints, and how Terraform enables VPN tunnels through infrastructure-as-code principles. This ensured the documentation was accurate and accessible to less technical audiences.
